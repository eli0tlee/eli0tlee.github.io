I am an exchange student from South Korea. I am double majoring in Statistics and Business Administration, and thinking of my career path as a Data Scientist. I have quite a lot of experiences handling data using programming languages such as Python and R. However, I have never learned about web programming before. As a Data Scientist, I think it would be helpful to be aware of the overall structure of web programming. This is why I am taking this course though it's not a mandatory course for me.
